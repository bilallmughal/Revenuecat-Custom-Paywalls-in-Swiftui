## Custom Paywall Integration with RevenueCat

To implement custom paywalls in your SwiftUI project using RevenueCat, follow these steps:

### 1. Install RevenueCat SDK
   - Add the RevenueCat SDK to your project via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.
   - Ensure proper setup and initialization of RevenueCat in your app.

### 2. Create Offerings in RevenueCat Console
   - Log in to the [RevenueCat Console](https://app.revenuecat.com).
   - Navigate to the "Offerings" section and set up the desired offerings (e.g., monthly, yearly subscriptions).
   - Organize the offerings into different packages that will be displayed on your custom paywall.
   - Update the json of metadata section according to needs.

### 3. Fetch Offerings in Your App
   - Implement the functionality to fetch available offerings from RevenueCat within your app.
   - Offerings will contain various packages (e.g., monthly or yearly subscriptions) which you can dynamically display on the custom paywall.

### 4. Design Your Custom Paywall View
   - Create a custom SwiftUI paywall view to display subscription packages.
   - Use dynamic data from the offerings to present relevant pricing, benefits, and subscription options.

### 5. Use MetaData for Customizations
   - In the RevenueCat Console, use MetaData to configure default tiles, layouts, and other visual customizations for your paywall.
   - Access and apply this MetaData in your app to manage UI elements and customize the appearance of the paywall dynamically.

### 6. Handle User Purchases
   - Implement the logic to allow users to purchase a subscription from the available packages.
   - Make sure to handle successful purchases, cancellations, and any potential errors.

### 7. Restore Previous Purchases
   - Provide a feature to allow users to restore their previous purchases in case of reinstallation or switching devices.

### 8. Test Your Integration
   - Ensure thorough testing of your paywall and purchasing flows in both sandbox and production environments.
